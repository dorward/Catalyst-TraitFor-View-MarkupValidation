NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::View::MarkupValidation - Validates output and
    replaces it with an error report if not OK

SYNOPSIS
        package Catalyst::View::Validation;

        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;

        extends qw/Catalyst::View::TT/;
        with qw/Catalyst::TraitFor::View::MarkupValidation/;

        1;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Role which which takes generated content that is ready for
    output and validates it. If there are errors it replaces the default
    output with an error report.

CAVEATS
    This is useful when you're developing your application, as it will
    identify validity errors in the markup. In production, however, the
    performance cost is likely to be too high, and throwing errors at users
    that browsers could probably recover from is unfriendly.

METHOD MODIFIERS
  after process
    Validates document and (in event of an error) replaces it with an error
    report.

TODO
    Make document types that get validated configurable
    Add line numbering to output
    Hyperlink from error to source

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Please report any you find using RT.

    If URI to validation service is incorrect, shows error report w/ 0
    errors.
